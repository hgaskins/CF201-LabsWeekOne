    <h3>Hello, welcome to my bio page and game. My name is Hannah Gaskins. Here is my brief biography. I was born in Minnesota and went to a Spanish immersion school. We also had many foreign exchange students stay with us, so most of my babysitters growing up were Spanish speakers from various latin american countries. I mention this becuase I love Spanish and see a lot of similarites in language learning and learning code. I also played many sports growing up including ice hockey, soccer and tennis. I got addicted to the endorphines early and continue to practice Yoga regualrly now. </h3>
    <h3>I went to the University of Wisconsin-Madison to study Art History and Business and then graduated to live in Chile for a year. I spent my time improving my Spanish, snowboarding, and eating Peruvian food - which is far superior to Chilean food.</h3>
    <h3>In my free time I play piano and guitar, hang out with my golden doodle Roo and cat Winnie, go to yoga and cook awesome food with my boyfriend. Thanks for stopping by!</h3>
